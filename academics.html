          <h2>
            Curriculum
          </h2>
          The undergraduate curriculum at IIT Dharwad is modelled after the curricula of the best universities in the
          world, and is truly one of the most exciting and versatile in India. It blends flexibility with academic
          rigor, allowing students to
          take up some courses of their own choice, both within and outside their departments, apart from completing a
          certain minimum requirement of “core” courses.

          <p>
            <br>
            Here at IITDh, the academic year is divided into two semesters, each lasting about 16 weeks. Each semester,
            you have to complete a certain number of credits/courses. Based on your performance, you are assigned a
            grade at the end of each
            course. The weighted average of your grade points for all the courses in a particular semester gives your
            Semester Performance Index (SPI). The weighted average of these SPIs gives your Cumulative Performance Index
            (CPI). CPI gives an
            overall impression of your academic performance and plays an important role in course/project allotment in
            later semesters, not to mention internships and placements.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Exceptional performance in a course can even earn you the highly valued AP grade in that course. Awarded
            rarely to less than 1% of the class strength, it is a feather in a cap worth striving for.

            Branch Change
          </h2>
          Students are eligible to apply for a change of branch/programme after completing the first two semesters and
          before the start of the third semester.
          Students above 8 CPI (General Category/OBC) & 7 CPI (SC/ST) with no backlogs after 1st year, are eligible to
          apply for branch change after the completion of the first year i.e., two semesters. Consequently, of all the
          applications for branch change, students are shifted to applied branches on Merit Basis. Detailed conditions
          and rules regarding branch change would be provided by the academic staff at the end of first year.

            CPI Calculation
          </h2>
          At the end of each semester, the weighted average of grades with credits of that particular course yields the
          SPI (Semester Performance Index) for that particular semester. The weighted average of SPI with the total
          credits of the semester yields the CPI (Cumulative Performance Index) for all the completed semesters.
